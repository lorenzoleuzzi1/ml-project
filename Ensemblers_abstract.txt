In this work we have implemented a feed-forward fully-connected Neural Network. 
We coded multiple variants of the Gradient Descent algorithm and tested them on the MONK's problems. 
To select the best model for the ML-CUP22 competition we performed a coarse-to-fine grained grid search over 
the hyper-parameters of the implemented Neural Network, using the k-fold cross validation technique. 
The final model we chose is an ensemble made by the 10 best hyper-parameters configurations.
